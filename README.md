android code to run on the robots

Currently broken. Need to update for a newer version of the API most likely

#Development

## Required software

### Android Studio
- Version 3.1.4 or higher. May not be buildable on lower versions

# Some Limitations

- Camera streaming will only work if the app has not been backgrounded (turning screen off is fine)
- Some devices act slow when streaming, still not sure what the main cause is.
